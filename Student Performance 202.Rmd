## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


This is how you load your data sheet. Remember to make sure it is a .csv file. Also, make sure your have set your working directory properly within your code chunk. You can use getwd() or setwd() or just specify it in the chunk like I did below.
```{r load your data, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
StudentPerformance202=read.csv(file="~/Documents/R_Files/R_data_files/Data_Files/BIO202_2016.csv", header=TRUE)
attach(StudentPerformance202)
```

Compare multiple groups by one single variable with box and whisker plots
```{r compare multiple groups by one single variable with box and whisker plots, echo=FALSE}
StudentPerformance202 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Lab.Group, y = FINAL.GRADE)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Lab.Group)) +
  ggtitle("Lab.Group Compared by Final Grade")

```

Here I have picked a new variable to compare, i.e. Exam 1 grade. Notice that I have also added points that represent each student from the lab groups. There are eight dots per lab group because this is two sections' worth of data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
StudentPerformance202 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Lab.Group, y = Exam.1.raw)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Lab.Group), outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(size=1.2, width = 0.15) +
  ggtitle("Lab.Group Compared by Exam.1.raw")
```


Create a subgroup of students who received below a 65% and then graph it.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- filter(StudentPerformance202, (Exam.1.raw <= 65))
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Lab.Group, y = Exam.1.raw)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Lab.Group), outlier.shape = NA) +
  ggtitle("Lab.Group Compared by Exam.1.raw")
```


Let's compare every single variable across the entire semester. Notice that I have added several layers to the plot to give you more options in your code. Also, to simplify the output I am going to compare each variable by lab section and not by lab group. Thus each graph in the panel will have two box and whisker plots instead of five or six.
```{r}
StudentPerformance202 %>% 
  select(c(1,3:32)) %>% 
  gather(-Child.Course.ID, key = "var", value = "value") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Child.Course.ID, y = value)) +
  facet_wrap(~ var) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Child.Course.ID), outlier.shape = NA) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank()) +
  ggtitle("Performance in BIO202 by Lab Section")
```

What I want to do next is explore whether there's any dependencies across all the variables. I will make a correlation matrix of only the grades that are on a scale of 0-100%. This is columns 3-32.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
numvar <- subset(StudentPerformance202, select = Case.Study.1..:FINAL.GRADE)
cor <- round(cor(numvar), 2)
```

Check your work by typing the name of your correlation matric object into the console window. You should see a very ugly display that includes the entire correlation matrix with both upper triangle and lower triangle. Let's carry on by just taking the upper triangle.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
upper<-cor
upper[upper.tri(cor)]<-""
upper<-as.data.frame(upper)
```

Use xtable R package to display nice correlation table in html format.
```{r xtable, results = "asis", echo=FALSE}
library(xtable)
print(xtable(upper), type="html")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# x is a matrix containing the data
# method : correlation method. "pearson"" or "spearman"" is supported
# removeTriangle : remove upper or lower triangle
# results :  if "html" or "latex"
  # the results will be displayed in html or latex format
corstars <-function(x, method=c("pearson", "spearman"), removeTriangle=c("upper", "lower"),
                     result=c("none", "html", "latex")){
    #Compute correlation matrix
    require(Hmisc)
    x <- as.matrix(x)
    correlation_matrix<-rcorr(x, type=method[1])
    R <- correlation_matrix$r # Matrix of correlation coeficients
    p <- correlation_matrix$P # Matrix of p-value 
    
    ## Define notions for significance levels; spacing is important.
    mystars <- ifelse(p < .0001, "****", ifelse(p < .001, "*** ", ifelse(p < .01, "**  ", ifelse(p < .05, "*   ", "    "))))
    
    ## trunctuate the correlation matrix to two decimal
    R <- format(round(cbind(rep(-1.11, ncol(x)), R), 2))[,-1]
    
    ## build a new matrix that includes the correlations with their apropriate stars
    Rnew <- matrix(paste(R, mystars, sep=""), ncol=ncol(x))
    diag(Rnew) <- paste(diag(R), " ", sep="")
    rownames(Rnew) <- colnames(x)
    colnames(Rnew) <- paste(colnames(x), "", sep="")
    
    ## remove upper triangle of correlation matrix
    if(removeTriangle[1]=="upper"){
      Rnew <- as.matrix(Rnew)
      Rnew[upper.tri(Rnew, diag = TRUE)] <- ""
      Rnew <- as.data.frame(Rnew)
    }
    
    ## remove lower triangle of correlation matrix
    else if(removeTriangle[1]=="lower"){
      Rnew <- as.matrix(Rnew)
      Rnew[lower.tri(Rnew, diag = TRUE)] <- ""
      Rnew <- as.data.frame(Rnew)
    }
    
    ## remove last column and return the correlation matrix
    Rnew <- cbind(Rnew[1:length(Rnew)-1])
    if (result[1]=="none") return(Rnew)
    else{
      if(result[1]=="html") print(xtable(Rnew), type="html")
      else print(xtable(Rnew), type="latex") 
    }
} 
```

```{r xtable with significance, results = "asis", echo=FALSE}
corstars(numvar[,1:29], result="html")
```
